<p><b>Execute only projects. </b>If you have opened two windows, the active
one being a Prolog File (pro) and the other one a Strawberry Project (spj).
If you press F5 (run) which one will be executed? This depends on
<b>Execute
only projects.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>'Next' is always active</b>
<p>When checked, makes the <a href="Trace_Menu_commands.html">Run|Next
Answer (F8)</a> command always available. This means that if no answer
is received (or we received no) <b>F8</b> will work like <b>Run (F5)</b>
. Use this option to customize your keys.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>'One Step' is always active</b>
<p>When checked, makes the <a href="Trace_Menu_commands.html">Trace|One
Step (F9)</a> command always available. This means that if no steps are
made <b>F9</b> will work like <b>First Step (Ctrl+F5)</b>. Use this option
to customize your keys.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Automatic Words Selection</b> This is an option of the editor. If
it is set on then the mouse selection takes words only. You cannot start
the selection from the middle of the word in this case.
<p><b>Change Information Font</b>
<p>Opens the characters dialog window to change the font for the Information
windows (the Stack window, the Variables window and the System List window
of the Tool menu).
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>View</b>
<p><b>Large Tool Bar (appears after restart) </b>Makes toolbar buttons
large. To change this option you need to restart the Prolog Compiler.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Sizable Bitmaps </b>When you change the size of the system font then
all dialog boxes resize automatically to fit the new font size. If this
option is selected then bitmaps in the Strawberry Prolog environment will
resize automatically too. If it is not selected then size and position
of the bitmaps will not change. If you set Small Fonts (from Control Panel/Display/Settings),
then we recommend you to tick off this option. If you use Large Fonts then
go on as you like it.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Tool Bar is Active on Start</b>
<br>This changes the behavior of the tool bar on start (visible or invisible).
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Status Bar is Active on Start</b>
<br>This changes the behavior of the status bar on start (visible or invisible).
<p><b>Splash on Start</b>
<br>This enables the splash window at the start of the compiler. Splash
window is the red square which appears for two seconds when the compiler
is starting.
<p><b>Proof Tree Always at the Top</b>
<br>This makes the Proof Tree a top-up window. It will be visible even
when it is not active. If you use this option then hide the Proof Tree
window by minimizing it and activate by <b>F12</b> .
<p><b>Automatic Scroll in Proof Tree</b>
<br>When you double click in the Proof Tree then you change the way it
looks. In this case automatic scroll will help you because it scrolls the
window but keeps the clicked subgoal static.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Colors</b>
<p>In this window you can change some colors which are used by the compiler.
Click <b>Set Default</b> button to set all values to default. Use <b>Change</b>
buttons to change any color. <b>Output</b> is the color of the output window;
other colors are used in system windows like <b>Proof Tree</b> and <b>Stack</b>
.
