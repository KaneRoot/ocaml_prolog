<hr><b><font size=+0>Settings of Project dialog box</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Settings</b>
<p><b>Fix First Random Number</b>
<br>Causes the system to generate the same pseudo-random number sequence
every time. This is useful when debugging a program that use random numbers.
Otherwise if the program displayed some suspicious behavior with some fixed
random sequence, it possibly will not do so with another. When you play
a game with random numbers this option have to be switched off. Otherwise
in all games will be happening the same things.
<p><b>Nested Comments allowed /* /* ... */ */</b>
<br>Enables the correct parsing of text that contains nested comments like
this /*.... /*....*/ ....*/. In the standard they are not allowed and if
you turn this option off then they will not work here either.
<p><b>Automatically Prolonged Stack</b>
<br>Enables the dynamic increasing of the stack.
<p><b>Stack Full as Fail</b>
<br>Causes the Stack Full event to be regarded as a failure of the current
goal, The use of this option can make the work of your program looking
rather strange!
<p><b>Use Default Memory</b>
<br>Use memory settings of the default project.
<p><b>Use Default Font</b>
<br>Use font settings of the default project.
<p><b>Change Window Font</b>
<br>Opens the characters dialog window to change the font of the text window
of the project itself or to change the default window font.
<p><a NAME="BP"></a><b>Break Point</b>
<br>Gives you the possibility to put a break point in your program and
make it active or passive. This break point is on step number. This is
one possibility, unique for Strawberry Prolog, that you do not have in
other languages or other Prolog compilers. If you want to put a break point
in the body of a clause then use the built-in predicate <b>trace</b> .
<p><b>Memory</b>
<p><b>Size of the Stack </b>The size of the goals stack.
<br><b>Variables (in K) </b>The total number of variables that can be allocated
in K (X1024).
<br><b>Linking Memory </b>The size of Linking memory in Kb. (it is used
in execution like the Stack).
<p>Use <b>SD</b> buttons (Set Default) to set to default value. The <b>start</b>
value is the value at the opening of the compiler. <b>At the moment</b>
is the value of the current moment and <b>Maximum</b> is the value which
cannot be exceeded.
