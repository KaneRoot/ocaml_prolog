<hr><b><font size=+0>Proof Tree</font></b>
<p>Opens a supplementary window in which program execution can be seen
in progress. The main branch of the proof tree under construction for the
goal being processed is displayed. The subgoals that have already been
successfully satisfied appear in <font color="#0000FF">blue</font> or in
<font color="#008000">green</font> . Those but partly satisfied (which
are satisfying at the moment) appear in <font color="#FF0000">red</font>,
and the ones not yet reached appear in <b>black</b> .
<p>Information in this window duplicates that in <a href="Stack_window.html">Stack
window</a> and other trace windows but it is easier to interpret.
<p>You can double click on <font color="#0000FF">blue</font> goals to see
how they are satisfied. Note that the terms that instantiate variables
in these branches can be seen too. If you double click a subgoal and hear
sound beep, this means that this subgoal is instantiated with an axiom.
If you want to receive the normal view of the Proof Tree again then double
click on the last <font color="#FF0000">red</font> subgoal. If you double
click on a <font color="#008000">green</font> subgoal then you will close
its subtree.
<p>You can use buttons <b>Home</b>, <b>End</b> and <b>Insert</b> for horizontal
scrolling of this window.
<p><b>Home</b> scrolls to the beginning (the most left point).
<br><b>End</b> scrolls to the end (the most right point).
<br><b>Insert</b> scrolls to the middle.
<p>Use also <b>Page Up</b> , <b>Page Down</b> and <b>arrows</b> .
<p><b>Warning:</b> The numbers of the variables in the subgoals which are
in <b>black</b> may be not real in some sense. The reason: If this number
is bigger than the maximum in the <a href="Variables_window.html">Variables</a>
window, then this is a not-instantiated variable with temporal number.
The numbers of other variables are real and they are shown in the <a href="Variables_window.html">Variables</a>
window. Of course, these numbers are real but not constant because after
backtracking they can change.
