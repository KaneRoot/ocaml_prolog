<br>&nbsp;
<p>A Strawberry Prolog program consists of up to three files and some additional
if defined:
<br>&nbsp;1) a <b>.def</b> -file, where reserved words are defined;
<br>&nbsp;2) an <b>.add</b> -file, where built-in predicates are declared
together with some other definitions;
<br>&nbsp;3) a <b>.pro </b>or
<b>.spj</b> -file, where the 'very' Prolog
'program' is found;
<br>&nbsp;4) additional files if they are defined in the project.
<p>The <b>.def</b> - and <b>.add</b> -files create the context for the
correct understanding of the program by the compiler (just like <b>.h</b>
-files in C).
<p>Compilation begins with reading the <b>.def</b> -file, in order to establish
correspondence between the numerical identifiers of the reserved words
and their string representation. The numerical identifiers of the reserved
words actually correspond to line numbers in the <b>.def</b> -file. This
way the user can modify any reserved word. It is essential to preserve
the order in this file.
<p>The next step of compilation is to read the <b>.add</b> -file which
defines some operators and the built-in predicates. This file lets one
redefine standard built-in predicates, or define new ones.
<p>After that is the compilation of the 'very program', that is contained
in the <b>.pro </b>or
<b>.spj</b> -file (the difference is that <b>.spj</b>
-file contains some settings, but the <b>.pro</b> -file uses the settings
of the default project),
<p>A Strawberry Prolog program must contain a <b>.pro</b> -file (or <b>.spj</b>
or <b>.txt</b> -file). If any of the others is missing, a corresponding
standard file is used in its place. These files all have the name <b>Standard</b>
and the corresponding extensions:
<p><b>Standard.def </b>The file containing the <i>standard </i>reserved
words.
<p><b>Standard.add </b>The file containing the declarations of the <i>standard</i>
built-in predicates.
