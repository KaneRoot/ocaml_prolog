<p>Strawberry Prolog supports OLE Automation - COM and ActiveX. This enables
you to command standard programs like MS Word or Excel using your Strawberry
Prolog program. This will open opportunities to incorporate such&nbsp;
programs into your Prolog program. This is not an absolutely new opportunity
because you can already do this by Visual Basic, Delphi and Visual C++.
However, Prolog (especially Strawberry Prolog) has definite advantages
over other program environments and they are:
<p>&nbsp;1. Basic is suitable only for short programs but when the program
becomes longer it gets messy.
<p>&nbsp;2. Delphi and Visual C++ are known as environments for professionals
not only because you can create professional work using them but also because
you need so much time to study through them that it is worth taking it
on only if this is your profession.
<p><b>If you want to command another program (server)</b> then you have
to know its commands (methods and properties). You can use the tool Object
Browser (from menu Tools). With the help of this tool you can see all OLE
servers which are installed on your computer. Also you can see their methods
and properties. You can use any other description of this server (interface)
provided by the authors of the server.
<p><b>Where to find a description of the server:</b> We cannot say in the
general case but for the most often used servers we will provide information
and links to sources documentation. If you want to use Microsoft Office
then we offer to visit Microsoft Office Developers page. If you want to
use some other server turn to the company which made it. Most commercial
applications support OLE Automation. This is the case of AutoCad 14 and
of many products of Microsoft like Word, Excel, Developers Studio etc.
Keep in mind that some programs do not support OLE Automation (are not
written as servers) and cannot be ruled from outside.
<p><b>Predicates for OLE Automation:</b> If you want to call a server then
you have first to open it. This can be done with the function:
<p><b>Server is server(ServerName)</b>
<p>Here has to be a string containing the name of the server. You can take
this name from the Object Browser. This function will return in <b>Server</b>
the object server and you should to use it to invoke its methods and to
set and get its properties.
<p>If you want to invoke method then use the function (or predicate) point.
What to use (function or the predicate) depends on that do you need the
return value of this predicate.
<p><b>R is Server.MethodName(Arg1, ... , Argn)</b>
<br><b>Server.MethodName(Arg1, ... , Argn)</b>
<p>Here <b>Server</b> has to be instantiated with an open server and <b>MethodName</b>
has to be a string containing the name of one of the methods of this server.
You can take this name also from the Object Browser. The arguments has
to be from the types which this method needs.
<p>If you want to get property then use again the function point. You can
put in any expression <b>Server.PropertyName</b> where <b>PropertyName
</b>is the string containing the name of one of the properties of this
server. You can take this name also from the Object Browser. For exampele
you can get property as follows:
<p><b>X is Server.PropertyName</b>
<p>If you want to set property then it is easy again. Simply type this:
<p><b>Server.PropertyName := Value</b>
<p>Here <b>Value</b> has to be this value which you want to set to this
property. Here as you see := can be used as set property. Of course, this
operation is stable on backtracking.
<p>When you want to close one server then use the predicate <b>close</b>
in this way:
<p><b>close(Server)</b>
<p>Here <b>Server</b> has to be instantiated with an open server which
you want to close.
