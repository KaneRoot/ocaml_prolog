<hr><b><font size=+0>E-mail predicates</font></b>
<p>Strawberry Prolog supports e-mail predicates.
<p>For UNIX use the predicate:
<p><b>s_mail(To, Name, Email, Subject, Mail)</b> which sends <b>Mail</b>
to recipient <b>To</b> , from <b>Name</b> with <b>Email</b> . (ONLY for
UNIX)
<p>To use e-mail predicates with MS Windows you need to install your Windows
Messaging System (<b>Inbox</b> ). You have to configure your own <b>profile</b>
in it. The name of this profile will be used to log in the messaging system
by the predicate
<b>logon(Profile, Password)</b> . The variable <b>Profile</b>
has to be instantiated with a string which contains the name of your profile
that you configured in the Inbox. If your profile is configured with password
then the variable <b>Password</b> should contain it (as a string). If you
do not set up a password then the variable <b>Password</b> can be the empty
string ( "" ). When the predicate <b>logon</b> will be executed then you
will be asked for the password of your e-mail account (this will not happen
if you set your e-mail account
password in the Inbox).

<p>To log out from the messaging system use the predicate <b>logoff</b>
.
<p>To send e-mail use <b>send_mail(Address, Subject, Mail)</b> . Here all
three variables have to be instantiated with strings. The <b>Address</b>
has to contain the e-mail address of the recipient or a name from the address
book. The <b>Subject</b> has to contain the subject of your e-mail. The
<b>Mail</b> have to contain the text of your e-mail.
<p>To read new e-mail use <b>read_new_mail(From, Subject, Mail)</b> . Here
all three variables have to be not-instantiated and they will be instantiated
with strings. The <b>From</b> will contain the e-mail address of the sender
of the e-mail. The <b>Subject</b> will contain the subject of the e-mail.
The <b>Mail</b> will contain the text of the e-mail. After execution of
this predicate the message will be marked as read. If there are not any
new messages the predicate will fail.
