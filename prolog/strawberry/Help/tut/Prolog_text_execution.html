<hr><i><font color="#010100"><font size=+1>Prolog Text Execution</font></font></i>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Here is a detailed general outline of the procedure that the Prolog
interpreter runs to execute <b>Prolog Text</b>.
<p>The input to this procedure is a single <b><i><font color="#008000"><font size=+1>goal</font></font></i></b>come,
say, as the <a href="Overall_structure_of_Strawberry_Prolog_`programs'.html">body</a>
of a <a href="Question.html">question</a> . The output is an answer <b><i><font color="#008000"><font size=+1>Yes</font></font></i></b>
or <b><i><font color="#008000"><font size=+1>No</font></font></i></b> to
'whether the goal is satisfiable', and, if a <b><i><font color="#008000"><font size=+1>Yes</font></font></i></b>
, a substitution of terms for the <a href="Variables.html">variables</a>
that occur in the goal.
<p>Basically, the interpreter satisfies <a href="Overall_structure_of_Strawberry_Prolog_`programs'.html">goals</a>
by searching for <a href="Fact.html">facts</a> and <a href="Rule.html">rules</a>
in the <b>run-time database</b> , that can be used for this purpose. A
goal may get satisfied and resatisfied several times within the work on
some parent goal. Every new time when a goal is to be satisfied, some part
of the <a href="Prolog_(run-time)_database.html">database</a> gets skipped
by the corresponding search, because the rules and facts in it have already
been given their turn in earlier times.
<p>To describe how this takes place precisely, it is useful to have in
mind a <b>work-state</b> of execution. This work-state contains <i>every
goal that is</i> , at the current point of time, <i>subject to resatisfaction</i>
, together with a <i>pointer into the database</i> . This pointer separates
the part of the database still subject to search from the part already
processed. The work-state as a whole is a sequence of goal-and-pointer
pairs. The initial work-state is the one with the single goal available
and a pointer to the first item of the database.
<p>The procedure consists of basically two kinds of steps, called <b>forward
steps</b> <b>and backward steps</b> , and some <b>control</b> on taking
them.
<p>A <b>forward step</b> for a given goal corresponds to either a fact
or a rule in the Prolog database with its head successfully <a href="Unification.html">unifiable</a>
with the goal. Performing a forward step means that:
<p>&nbsp;1. The interpreter allocates all the <a href="Variables.html">variables</a>
that occur in the fact or rule in question.
<br>&nbsp;2. Next it <a href="Unification.html">unifies</a> the fact, or
the head of the rule, if a rule is the case, with the goal, letting the
variables that get substituted by this <a href="Unification.html">unification</a>
to be instantiated to these substitutes. Note that variables that come
with the goal, and are not newly allocated, can get instantiated at this
point too.
<br>&nbsp;3. If the database item that triggers the forward step is a fact,
the above completes the step as a successful one. If this item happens
to be a rule, the sequence of goals that are the body of the rule is processed
to try to satisfy the goals themselves by applying the entire backtracking
procedure on each of them, with all the instantiations so far made in effect.
This is done by attaching their conjunction to the beginning of the work-state
with a pointer to the first item of the database.
<p><b>Performing a backward step</b> , that is needed in case some forward
steps are still needed, though made impossible by the choices of the database
items to work with, is undoing the above actions, that constitute a forward
step.
<p>Now <b>the control over forward and backward steps</b> is as follows:
<p>The topmost goal-and-pointer is extracted from the work-state. A forward
step is made with the goal selected and the first item from the run-time
database that is at the pointer position or lower, and successfully unifies
with the goal. If this item happens to be a rule, its body takes the topmost
position in the new work-state together with a pointer to the beginning
of the run-time database, as stated above. In both cases a pointer into
the database, pointing to the item just next to the one extracted, gets
stored. Informally, the above are the actions taken to initiate the application
of a rule, or to find an appropriate fact.
<p>The above control step is repeated as long as possible. With the case
of rules in mind, where body-goals take place in the work-state, and when
having reached its top, get processed by corresponding forward steps, one
can imagine how a complex goal gets processed by a series of successful
forward steps.
<p>Normally, there are also failures to satisfy a goal. The work-state
represents failure as an attempt to find an item in the database to launch
a forward step, when the pointer component of the topmost element of the
work-state points to the very end of the database, i.e. no more choices
of facts and rules are available. Then the interpreter makes a backward
step by undoing the forward step for the latest successfully satisfied
goal, and places it, together with the pointer into the database that was
stored upon its forward step, on top of the work-state. As this pointer
points just next to the run-time database item that launched that forward
step, the new work-state dictates an attempt to resatisfy the same goal
using the same database without the items already proven not successful.
<p><font color="#010100"><font size=+1>Remark:</font></font> The above
can be viewed as just a case of the more general backtracking procedure
as described in the literature on programming.
