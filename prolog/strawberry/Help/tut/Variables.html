<br>&nbsp;
<p>Variables in Prolog are a means to name <a href="Terms.html">terms</a>
that become known at run-time.
<p><b>A variable's name starts with a capital letter</b> or <b><i><font color="#008000"><font size=+1>_</font></font></i></b>
, followed by an arbitrary sequence of letters, digits and <b><i><font color="#008000"><font size=+1>_</font></font></i></b>
s. The variable, whose name is just <b><i><font color="#008000"><font size=+1>_</font></font></i></b>
, has a special role in Prolog. It is called the <a href="The_anonymous_variable.html">anonymous
variable</a>.
<p><b>A variable gets allocated, when</b> the <a href="Overall_structure_of_Strawberry_Prolog_`programs'.html">clause</a>
(fact or rule) it occurs in is about to be applied. A variable does not
get deallocated after successfully satisfying the <a href="Overall_structure_of_Strawberry_Prolog_`programs'.html">goals</a>
that comprise the successful application of this clause. Rather, it gets
deallocated when the application of the <a href="Prolog_text_execution.html">clause</a>
it got allocated in is cancelled in order, to e.g. resatisfy the goal that
launched it, by a backward step.
<p><b>From its allocation a variable is available for instantiation</b>
, i.e. for assigning it a term to stand for. The same variable can be instantiated
and then uninstantiated unlimitedly many times. This is so because, after
its allocation, the variable in general becomes part of terms, that get
passed to subgoals, given rise by the application of the clause which caused
the variable to get allocated. Here <a href="Prolog_text_execution.html">forward
steps</a> and <a href="Prolog_text_execution.html">backward steps</a> can
cause instantiation and uninstantiation both of locally allocated variables
and earlier allocated ones.
<p><b>A variable loses its value</b> , i.e. gets <b>uninstantiated</b>
again, only after backward steps on a clause that caused it to get a value
- get instantiated. Note that, a loss of value, and not of allocation,
is what happens. The backward step doesn't need to be on the clause that
caused allocation.
<p>It is sometimes possible for one variable to get instantiated to a term
that consists of just another variable. This case of <a href="Unification.html">unification</a>
is remarkable for its violating the <i>branch-replaces-leaf</i> intuition
for the effect of instantiation on the tree representations of terms. The
definition of <b>sharing of the two variables</b> has been adopted, because
whatever in the future instantiates one of the two, immediately does so
with the other.
