<hr><b><font size=+0>What are the advantages of buying of subscriotion?</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;1. If you buy a subscription before the release of version 2.0
then you get the right to buy all future versions (after 3.0) for half
of the upgrade price.
<br>&nbsp;2. If you buy a subscription for the Professional edition now
then you obtain the right to buy with it also <b>200</b> shares at <b>50</b>
cents per share (look at <b>shares.html</b> in our site). This means that
for <b>$349 USD</b> (
<b>$249</b> for the license and <b>$100</b> for shares)
you can obtain <b>200</b> shares and license for versions 1.x, 2.x professional
editions and version 3.0.
<br>&nbsp;3. There will be <a href="The_Lottery.html">a lottery</a> between
customers who bought a subscription before the release of version 2.0.
<br>&nbsp;4. You obtain technical support by e-mail and we will try to
remove immediately all the problems in the compiler that hamper your work.
