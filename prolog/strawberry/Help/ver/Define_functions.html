<hr><b><font size=+0>Define functions and Built-in predicates</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>In Strawberry Prolog you have the unique possibility to define your
own functions and built-in predicates. Here you can normally ask the question:
What is the difference between standard Prolog predicates and built-in
predicates. Usually in the most Prolog compilers built-in predicates are
called to such predicates you cannot define alone and that is why they
are defined in the system. In Strawberry Prolog the situation is different,
you can define your own built-in predicates. So what is the difference
between built-in and standard predicates? You define built-in predicates
with fixed types and fixed number of the arguments. When these predicates
are executed then the types and the number of the arguments are checked
and if it is not correct then an error message is displayed. Also, in the
built-in predicates you can give an expression as an argument. This expression
will be calculated before execution of the built-in predicate, then the
predicate will be executed and the value of the expression will be given
to it on the place of respective argument.
<p>Maybe you are a little bit disappointed by such built-in predicates
because you expected that they are written in another language like C and
also that they are hidden somewhere in the system and you cannot see their
definition. It doesn't matter that your predicate is built-in or not, if
you want to make it written in C or in another language then you can do
this and put it in a DLL file or in OLE server. After that you can call
such a function from Strawberry Prolog. If you want to hide your predicate's
definition then you can put it in Standard.add file or you can create your
own ADD file to contain your built-in predicates and other often used by
you Prolog source.
<p>Well, but how to define functions and Built-in predicates in Strawberry
Prolog. Here is how such definitions look like:
<p><i><font color="#008000"><font size=+1>R is f(X</font><font size=+0>1</font><font size=+1>,
X</font><font size=+0>2</font><font size=+1>, ... , X</font><font size=+0>n</font><font size=+1>)
:- G</font><font size=+0>1</font><font size=+1>, G</font><font size=+0>2</font><font size=+1>,
... , G</font><font size=+0>m</font><font size=+1>.</font></font></i>
<br><i><font color="#008000"><font size=+1>*** p(X</font><font size=+0>1</font><font size=+1>,
X</font><font size=+0>2</font><font size=+1>, ... , X</font><font size=+0>n</font><font size=+1>)
:- G</font><font size=+0>1</font><font size=+1>, G</font><font size=+0>2</font><font size=+1>,
... , G</font><font size=+0>m</font><font size=+1>.</font></font></i>
<p>Where Xi is variable with some specifiers eventually. Here is the list
of all possible types specifiers which you can use in the definition of
functions and of built-in predicates:
<p><b>int X </b>- integer
<br><b>float X</b> - floating point number
<br><b>str X </b>- string
<br><b>obj(X)</b> - object
<br><b>var(X)</b> - variable
<br><b>term(X)</b> - term, i.e. no one from the above
<br><b>io(X)</b> - used for input and output
<br><b>num(X)</b> - the same as <b>int float X</b>
<br><b>X</b> - the same as <b>int float str obj(var(term(X)))</b> , i.e.
calculate and don't check the type
<br><b>nocalc(X)</b> - this means that this argument should not be calculated
and will be given as a term as this is with the standard Prolog predicates.
<p>The first three specifiers are defined as prefix operators and that's
why they don't need brackets. You can define one argument using several
specifiers. In this case the meaning is OR, i.e. the value must be one
of the specified types. The row and repetition of specifiers are not important,
i.e <b>int float X</b> is the same as <b>float int X</b> or even <b>int
int float X</b> . You cannot combine the specifier nocalc with any of the
rest.
<p>As you can see the definition of built-in predicate is the same as the
definition of the standard one with the difference that you have to put
the key word *** and the arguments cannot be any terms like this is in
the standard predicates but they must be only variables, eventually with
some specifiers. You can define one built-in predicate (or function) with
more than one clause as with standard predicates but in this case in all
definition clauses the number of variables (in the head) and all specifiers
must be the same. For example:
<p><i><font color="#008000"><font size=+1>*** p(X</font><font size=+0>1</font><font size=+1>,
X</font><font size=+0>2</font><font size=+1>, ... , X</font><font size=+0>n</font><font size=+1>)
:- body_</font><font size=+0>1</font><font size=+1>.</font></font></i>
<br><i><font color="#008000"><font size=+1>&nbsp;.</font></font></i>
<br><i><font color="#008000"><font size=+1>&nbsp;.</font></font></i>
<br><i><font color="#008000"><font size=+1>&nbsp;.</font></font></i>
<br><i><font color="#008000"><font size=+1>*** p(X</font><font size=+0>1</font><font size=+1>,
X</font><font size=+0>2</font><font size=+1>, ... , X</font><font size=+0>n</font><font size=+1>)
:- body_</font><font size=+0>m</font><font size=+1>.</font></font></i>
<p>Here if the first body fails the compiler will try to satisfy the next
one and so on.
<p>Let's see an example for defining of function and for built-in predicate:
<p><i><font color="#008000"><font size=+1>R is add(X, Y) :- R:=X+Y.</font></font></i>
<br><i><font color="#008000"><font size=+1>*** my_write(X) :- beep, writeq(X),
nl.</font></font></i>
<p>What we have defined? The new function <b>add</b> is actually the same
as the <b>+</b> function which we already have. You can put it in expressions
and it will calculate the expressions <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b> and after that
will execute the body of the function where it will calculate the value
of R. The only small difference between <b>add</b> and <b>+</b> is that
the first will accept any kind of expressions for <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b>
with the difference of <b>+</b> which accepts only integer, float and string
values for them. This means that you can give two variables or terms for
<b>X</b>
and <b>Y</b> and <b>add</b> will accept them. Anyway, when the execution
of the body of <b>add</b> starts you will receive an error message from
the function <b>+</b> . This message will say that the arguments of
<b>+</b>
cannot be variables or terms but you will not get such a message for the
function <b>add</b> .
<p>If you want then you can make a type check in the <b>add</b> function.
Let's say that we want to check whether their arguments are integer or
float. Then we can define add as follows:
<p><i><font color="#008000"><font size=+1>R is add(int float X, int float
Y) :- R:=X+Y.</font></font></i>
<p>Now our <b>add</b> function is like <b>+</b> but only for integer and
float numbers. If we try to concatenate strings with it then we will receive
an error message which says that the arguments can not be strings.
<p>The built-in predicate <b>my_write</b> is the same as <b>write</b> predicate
(only one beep and one new line are small differences). If we call <b>my_write(2+2)</b>
in our program then what will be written in the Output window? Will it
be <b>4</b> as if we call write or will it be <b>2+2</b> as if we call
<b>writeq</b>
. The predicate <b>my_write</b> will write <b>4</b> although we use <b>writeq</b>
in its body because the expression will be calculated before the execution
of the body. If we want to make <b>my_write</b> like
<b>writeq</b> then
we should define it as follows:
<p><i><font color="#008000"><font size=+1>*** my_write(nocalc(X)) :- beep,
writeq(X), nl.</font></font></i>
<p>When defining functions and built-in predicates you can use also the
operator <b>:--</b> instead of <b>:-</b> . What is the difference? After
the compilation all clauses which have the same heads are represented as
a chain. Every one has a pointer to the next. So, when the program is executed
if the first clause from the chain fails then the interpreter takes the
next one. If you define a clause using <b>:--</b> instead of <b>:-</b>
then this clause will have a chain pointer to itself. This mean that this
clause will be recalled forever (the same as if this clause was infinitely
many times in the program). For example by <b>:--</b> is defined the predicate
repeat.
<p>For examples of functions defined on Prolog is a good idea to look at
<font size=+1>Strawberry
functions</font> . Their definitions are in the Standard.add file.
