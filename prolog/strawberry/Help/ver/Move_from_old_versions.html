<hr><b><font size=+0>Move from old versions to this one</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>This is a help tool which is provided for people who have programs which
work with an old version of Strawberry Prolog but do not work with this
one due to some small changes which we made in the built-in predicates.
<p>All such changes are described here. In order to correct your program
start from the last version with which your program is working and make
all changes to the current version.
<p><b>From version 1.6 to version 1.7</b>
<p>The key word <b>built_in</b> is changed. If you have it in your program
you should to replace it with <b>***</b>.
<p><b>From version 1.2 to version 1.21</b>
<p>In this version the predicate for is changed. If you have <b>for(I,A,B)</b>
in the old version it would make a loop for <b>I</b> from <b>A</b> up to
<b>B</b> but without <b>B</b>. In this version the loop will be from <b>A</b>&nbsp;
to <b>B</b> (included).
<p>The easiest way to correct this in your old programs is to replace <b>for(I,A,B)</b>
with <b>for(I, A, B- 1)</b> everywhere. Note that in this version you can
write expressions in the place of <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>. Analogically&nbsp;
if you have <b>for(I,A,B,Step)</b> then replace it with <b>for(I,A,B- 1,Step)</b>
if the <b>Step</b> is positive and with <b>for(I,A,B+1,Step)</b> if the
<b>Step</b> is negative.
<p>Other change is in the predicates <b>size</b> and <b>position</b>. Now
they have one more argument which shows which is the window that is all
about. The easiest way to correct your old programs is to replace everywhere
<b>size(X,Y)</b> with <b>size(_,X,Y)</b> and analogically for the <b>position</b>.
<p>If you use <b>brush(R,G,B)</b> where <b>R</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>B</b> mean
reed, green and blue then you have to replace it with <b>brush(rgb(R,G,B))</b>.
<p>Predicate <b>count_list</b> is changed with function and its name is
<b>list_length</b>
<p><b>From version 1.02 to version 1.2</b>
<p>Many predicates now are functions and you have to change their syntax.
For example is you have in your program <b>print(S, T)</b>, then you should
to replace it with <b>S is print(T)</b>. The full list of predicates which
became functions follows:
<p><b>get</b>
<br><b>get_text</b>
<br><b>open</b>
<br><b>parent</b>
<br><b>print</b>
<br><b>random</b>
<br><b>rgb</b>
<br><b>scan</b>
<br><b>system_color</b>
<br><b>select_file</b>
<br><b>select_color</b>
<p>In version 1.2 the way in which you can define functions is changed.
For example, if you wish to define function <b>add(X,Y)</b> and to use
it like <b>Result is add(2,2)</b> to obtain <b>4</b> then the old definition
style is:
<br><i><font color="#008000">add(Result, X, Y) :- Result is X + Y.</font></i>
<p>and the new style is:
<br><i><font color="#008000">Result is add(X,Y) :- Result is X + Y.</font></i>
<p><b>From version 1.0 (beta release) to version 1.0 (beta release2)</b>
<p>predicate <b>/</b> is changed with <b>//</b>.
<br>predicate <b>get_time</b> is changed with <b>chronometer</b>
<br>The argument of <b>wait</b> now is in seconds, not in centiseconds.
Correct it by changing <b>Time</b> with <b>Time/100</b>.
<br>The predicates <b>get</b>, <b>put</b>, <b>get_text</b> and <b>set_text</b>
changed the places of their first two arguments.
<p>The predicates <b>bitmap</b> and <b>icon</b> lost their last two arguments.
<p><b>From version 0.7 to version 1.0 (beta release)</b>
<p>The predicates: <b>pen</b>, <b>brush</b>, <b>window_brush</b>, <b>color_text</b>,
<b>color_text_back,</b> <b>select_color</b> are changed. The change is
that instead of three arguments for the color now they have only one argument.
Correct them by changing of <b>Red</b>, <b>Green</b>, <b>Blue</b> with
<b>rgb( Red, Green, Blue)</b>.
