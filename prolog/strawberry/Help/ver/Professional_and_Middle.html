<br>&nbsp;
<p>The <b>Professional Edition</b> of Strawberry Prolog is our higher edition
which includes all facilities and tools. The main advantage of the Professional
edition comparing the Middle one is the possibilities to create Prolog
CGI scripts and to build EXE files. These EXE files are very small but
they need an installation of the Light Edition of Strawberry Prolog for
work. This cannot be a problem because this edition is very small in size
and is free downloadable.
<p>Professional edition of Strawberry Prolog is not freeware. If you want
a password for it then you have to buy a license. We offer a subscription
for all versions including 3.0. Now the price for this is $249 USD and
we offer a <a href="Student_Discount.html">student discount</a> which is
$119 USD.
<p>The <b>Middle Edition</b> of Strawberry Prolog have complete functionality
except creating of Prolog CGI scripts and EXE files. Like the Professional
edition it is not freeware. You have to buy a subscription for it (which
include all versions including 3.0). There will be a second possibility
to obtain the middle edition. We will give it as a shareware for one month
evaluation period together with the CD of some computer magazines. If you
obtain the Middle edition from computer magazine then you have right to
use it only for one month and only this version which is on the CD.
<p>Now the price for subscription for the Middle edition is $98 USD and
we offer a <a href="Student_Discount.html">student discount</a> which is
$49 USD.
<p>The <b>Light&nbsp; Edition</b> of Strawberry Prolog is freeware and
you can download and use it for free.&nbsp; Light edition has restricted
functionality but its purpose is to represent the power of Strawberry Prolog
and to canvass you to buy the higher version.
<p>In the future the difference between the Light, Middle and Professional
edition will grow. We will
<p>develop all editions but the Light one will serve only for giving an
idea to the user what are
<br>the advantages of Strawberry Prolog.
