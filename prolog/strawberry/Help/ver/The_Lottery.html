<br>&nbsp;
<p>We also have a lottery for our customers who bought a subscription before
the release of version 2.0. Five randomly selected of them will win. The
chance will be bigger for those who bought earlier. Your chance will be
proportional to the number <b>ALL+1-N</b> , where <b>ALL</b> is the number
of all people who bought a subscription and <b>N</b> is your number. This
means that the person who buys first enjoys twice the bigger chance to
win over that in the middle. And the person at the end has minimal chance
(almost zero).
<p>The prize which they will share is 10% of all money collected from subscription
buying until the release of Version 2.0.
<p>An additional prize will be granted to one of those who have bought
a subscription before the release of version 1.0. This prize will be 2%
of all money collected from subscription buying before the release of version
2.0.
<p>The winners will have the opportunity to choose to take the money or
to go for a different experience, like for example, a trip to the Bulgarian
seaside.
<p>All free licenses which are given by contest or by any other reason
do not give the right to participate in the lottery.
