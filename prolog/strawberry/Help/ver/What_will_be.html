<hr><b><font size=+0>What Will Be the Next Versions?</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>The versions 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7</b> were a very early editions of Strawberry
Prolog and we did not recommend them for serious work. They are free for
use and distribution (including business purposes), like 1.0.
<p><b>This version 1.0</b> is the first version which is good enough even
for professionals. This will be the last absolutely free version. In our
opinion it is already the best Prolog compiler in the world!
<p><b>Versions 1.x</b> will be in three editions, Light, Middle and Professional.
The Light edition will be freeware. The professional and middle editions
will be available for the ones who made subscription for Strawberry Prolog.
This subscription includes the current version and all future versions
including <b>3.0</b> . When you bought a subscription you will receive
a personal password which can be used to download all future versions including
<b>3.0</b>
. The cost for this subscription for the moment is only <b>$249</b> USD
for the Professional edition and <b>$98</b> USD for the Middle edition
(look at <a href="Buying_a_subscriotion.html">buy a subscription</a> ).
<p><b>Version 2.x and 3.0</b> will be not free and they will have unique
features. One of them will be the Loop checking. These versions will be
available to you if you bought a subscription for Strawberry Prolog (look
at <a href="Buying_a_subscriotion.html">buy a subscription</a> ).
